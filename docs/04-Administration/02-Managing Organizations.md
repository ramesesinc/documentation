## Organization

ETRACS is not a stand-alone system. In fact, the idea is to allow ETRACS
to be networkable to other ETRACS servers. Thus the root organization of
ETRACS refers to the main organization or the LGU. Other Organizations
include the barangays, terminals, hospitals etc. For a province, the
root organization is the province and sub organizations would be the
municipalities. So the system will know what organization the user wants
to login to, the org name must be specified in the client code in the
login screen. (See screen below). If not specified, the root
organization will be used.
